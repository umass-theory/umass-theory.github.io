title: Theory Seminar
---
Welcome to the Fall 2025 series of the **University of Massachusetts Computer Science Theory Seminar**. The seminar is **noon-1 pm on Wednesdays** in **LGRC A311**, in the Lederle Graduate Research Center (lowrise) at UMass Amherst, and is free and open to the public. The faculty hosts are [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/) and [Hedyeh Beyhaghi](https://hedyehbeyhaghi.github.io/). If you are interested in giving a talk, please email the faculty hosts, or [Adam Lechowicz](https://adamlechowicz.github.io/#contact). Note that in addition to being a public lecture series, this is also a one-credit graduate seminar (**CompSci 891M**) that can be taken repeatedly for credit.

All Wednesday talks are in **LGRC A311**, unless otherwise stated.

##### Rethinking Information in Mechanism Design

[Divyarthi Mohan](https://www.divyarthimohan.com/) (Boston University) --  *Wednesday, September 10 @ noon*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Online markets and platforms have drastically shaped the algorithmic landscape into a complex ecosystem of strategic or self-interested entities. Hence, it is important to design algorithmic systems that are robust to strategic behavior and other informational uncertainties in order to guarantee desirable outcomes. In this talk, I will focus on my recent work that tackles three important challenges—uncertain decision making, strategic behavior, and interdependence—by using approximation algorithms to go beyond standard assumptions on information structures.

##### ML for discrete optimization: Theoretical foundations

[Ellen Vitercik](https://vitercik.github.io/) (Stanford) --  *Wednesday, September 17 @ noon*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Many of the most important optimization problems in practice are massive in scale, mathematically complex, and involve numerous unknown parameters. Machine learning offers a powerful way to address these challenges by uncovering hidden structure and improving decision quality, but integrating predictions into algorithms raises fundamental questions: which architectures align with combinatorial structure, and how can we ensure robustness to error? This talk presents two case studies. First, we show how graph neural networks can approximate the optimal dynamic program for online matching, yielding algorithms that generalize across graph sizes and achieve strong empirical performance. Second, we introduce calibration as a principled interface between machine learning and decision-making, demonstrating through rent-or-buy and job scheduling problems that calibrated predictions yield both theoretical guarantees and practical improvements. Together, these results illustrate how learning can meaningfully augment algorithm design while retaining rigorous performance guarantees. This is joint work with Alexandre Hayderi, Amin Saberi, Anders Wikum, and Judy Hanwen Shen.
