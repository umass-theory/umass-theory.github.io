title: Theory Seminar
---
Welcome to the Spring 2026 series of the **University of Massachusetts Computer Science Theory Seminar**. The seminar is **4-5 pm on Tuesdays** in **Room 140, in the Computer Science Building (CSB) at UMass Amherst**, and is free and open to the public. The faculty host this semester is [Cameron Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/). If you are interested in giving a talk, please email the faculty host, or [Adam Lechowicz](https://adamlechowicz.github.io/#contact). Note that in addition to being a public lecture series, this is also a one-credit graduate seminar (**CompSci 891M**) that can be taken repeatedly for credit.

##### Double Header: Fairness in the k-Server Problem and The Secretary Problem with Predictions and a Chosen Order

[Mohammadreza Daneshvaramoli](https://moreda-a.github.io/) --  *Tuesday, February 10 @ 4pm*

<summary>Abstract </summary>
**Part 1:** We formalize fairness for the \(k\)-server problem via \((\alpha,\beta)\)-fairness: each server's cost is at most an \(\alpha/k\) fraction of the total plus \(\beta\). We show fairness can be achieved without losing competitiveness.
Offline, we transform any optimal solution into a fair one with \(\alpha=1+\epsilon\) and \(\beta=O(diam \cdot \log k/\epsilon)\) while incurring only an additive \(O(diam \cdot k\log k/\epsilon)\) cost.
Online, we convert any competitive algorithm into a randomized algorithm that is fair with high probability against an oblivious adversary, with only a small competitiveness loss.
We also analyze classics: DCA is fair on lines and on trees for \(k=2\) but fails on general trees; on paging, FIFO is fair and marking algorithms (including LRU) satisfy a weaker fairness notion.

**Part 2:** We study the secretary problem with value predictions in both the standard random-order model (ROSP) and a learning-augmented model where the decision-maker can choose the arrival order based on predictions (COSP). We design a randomized algorithm that trusts predictions unless a large deviation is detected, then switches to a threshold rule.
If \(\epsilon\in[0,1]\) bounds the multiplicative prediction error, we obtain competitive ratio \(\max\{0.221,\frac{1-\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}\}\) for ROSP (improving [Fujii Yoshida '23]) and \(\max\{0.262,\frac{1-\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}\}\) for COSP, demonstrating the benefit of combining predictions with arrival-order control.

##### Characterizing Strong Proofs Systems via Total Search Problems

[Stefan Grosser](https://blog.catalangrenade.com/p/about.html) (McGill) --  *Tuesday, February 17 @ 4pm*
<details markdown="1"  open="1">
<summary>
In 1929, Gödel proved his celebrated completeness theorem, showing that in first-order logic a statement is true if and only if it has a finite proof. Exactly fifty years later, Cook and Reckhow asked whether a stronger phenomenon might hold in propositional logic: is there a fixed proof system—such as the sequent calculus or ZFC—in which every tautology admits a short proof? Equivalently, does NP = coNP? This question lies at the heart of propositional proof complexity, whose central goal is to show that for every proof system there exist tautologies that require exponentially long proofs.

In this talk, we survey a recent and successful line of work in proof complexity that connects the strength of proof systems to the complexity of combinatorial search problems. We will see how short proofs correspond to efficient algorithms (and conversely), and how this connection has been used to obtain new lower bounds in both proof complexity and circuit complexity. This talk is based on joint work with Noah Fleming, Toniann Pitassi, and Robert Robere.
