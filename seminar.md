Welcome to the Spring 2025 series of the **University of Massachusetts Computer Science Theory Seminar**. The seminar is **4-5 pm on Tuesdays** in **CS 140**, in the Computer Science Building at UMass Amherst, and is free and open to the public. The faculty host is [Yair Zick](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yzick/). If you are interested in giving a talk, please email Professor Zick or [Adam Lechowicz](https://adamlechowicz.github.io/#contact). Note that in addition to being a public lecture series, this is also a one-credit graduate seminar (**CompSci 891M**) that can be taken repeatedly for credit.

All Tuesday talks are in **CS 140**, unless otherwise stated.

##### Pseudorandom Error-Correcting Codes with Applications to Watermarking Generative AI

[Miranda Christ](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mchrist/) (Columbia) --  *Tuesday, February 18 @ 4 pm*

<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
The rise of increasingly realistic generative models has necessitated tools for distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated content. A promising approach is watermarking, where a hidden pattern is embedded in this AI-generated content. We introduce a powerful new framework for watermarking, which can be instantiated with a cryptographic primitive that we define, called a pseudorandom error-correcting code (PRC). While motivated by watermarking, a PRC is a natural cryptographic object of independent interest.

A PRC is an error-correcting code with the property that any polynomial number of codewords are pseudorandom to any efficient adversary. We construct PRCs from standard cryptographic assumptions, and in this talk I will give an overview of our construction relying on subexponential hardness of LPN. I will then show how PRCs yield LLM watermarks with strong quality and robustness guarantees.

This is based on works with Sam Gunn, Omar Alrabiah, Prabhanjan Ananth, and Yevgeniy Dodis: [https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/235.pdf](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/235.pdf), [https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1840](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1840)

##### Equilibrium Computation in the Hotelling-Downs Model of Spatial Competition

[Soumyajit Pyne](https://sites.google.com/view/soumyajitpyne) (TIFR) --  *Tuesday, March 11 @ 4 pm*
<details markdown="1" open='1'>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
The Hotelling-Downs model is a natural and appealing model for understanding strategic positioning by candidates in elections. In this model, voters are distributed on a line, representing their ideological position on an issue. Each candidate then chooses as a strategy a position on the line to maximize her vote share. Each voter votes for the nearest candidate, closest to their ideological position. This sets up a game between the candidates, and we study pure Nash equilibria in this game. The model and its variants are an important tool in political economics, and are studied widely in computational social choice as well.

Despite the interest and practical relevance, most prior work focuses on the existence and properties of pure Nash equilibria in this model, ignoring computational issues. Our work gives algorithms for computing pure Nash equilibria in the basic model. We give three algorithms, depending on whether the distribution of voters is continuous or discrete, and similarly, whether the possible candidate positions are continuous or discrete. In each case, our algorithms return either an exact equilibrium or one arbitrarily close to exact, assuming existence. We believe our work will be useful, and may prompt interest, in computing equilibria in the wide variety of extensions of the basic model as well.

##### Sub-quadratic $$(1+\epsilon)$$-approximate Euclidean Spanners, with Applications

[Hengjie Zhang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhj/) (Columbia) --  *Tuesday, April 8 @ 4 pm*
<details markdown="1" open='1'>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
  
We study graph spanners for point-set in the high-dimensional Euclidean space. On the one hand, we prove that spanners with stretch $$<\sqrt{2}$$ and subquadratic size are not possible, even if we add Steiner points. On the other hand, if we add extra nodes to the graph (non-metric Steiner points), then we can obtain $$(1+\epsilon)$$-approximate spanners of subquadratic size. We show how to construct a spanner of size $$n^{2-\Omega(\epsilon^3)}$$, as well as a directed version of the spanner of size $$n^{2-\Omega(\epsilon^2)}$$.

We use our directed spanner to obtain an algorithm for computing $$(1+\epsilon)$$-approximation to Earth-Mover Distance (optimal transport) between two sets of size $$n$$ in time $$n^{2-\Omega(\epsilon^2)}$$.
